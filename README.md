STT : Speech to Text

It enables the audio data received on the LiveKit media server to be converted into text via DeepGram.

This sample project connects to the LiveKit (livekit.io) room, for which the relevant access information is provided, and sends the received audio data to the DeepGram (deepgram.com) api address. It prints the text information returned from DeepGram to the console.
